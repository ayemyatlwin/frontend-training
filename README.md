## Web Development Training Day 1: HTML Basics

This project is a structured guide to learning **HTML5, Forms, and Tables**.  
It serves as both a demonstration of **semantic web structure** and a **practical exercise** for using Developer Tools.

---

## 1. Semantic Structure

Organizing code for better accessibility and SEO:

- `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for layout
- `<h1>` through `<h3>` for content hierarchy

---

## 2. Block vs. Inline Elements

Understanding how elements occupy space:

**Block-level elements** (take up full width):

- `<p>`
- `<div>`
- `<table>`

**Inline elements** (sit side-by-side):

- `<a>`
- `<span>`
- `<strong>`

---

## 3. Interactive Forms

A registration form utilizing various input methods:

- `<input type="text">` with required validation
- `<select>` and `<option>` for dropdown menus
- `<button type="submit">` for data submission

---

## 4. Data Tables

Structured data display using:

- `<table>`
- `<tr>` (rows)
- `<th>` (headers)
- `<td>` (data)

---

## 📖 Recommended Resources (W3Schools)

I used **W3Schools** as a primary reference for this project:

- HTML Elements & Attributes
- HTML Forms and Inputs
- CSS Box Model Guide
- HTML Display Property (Block / Inline)
